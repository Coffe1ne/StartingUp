            <p class="first Par">I was expected to drop-out,
                I’ve held myself to a higher standard, lost respect from my family,I tell you sincerely that I’m serious
                about changing my life,Once I’ve been criticized,Twice I’ve been shaped into the man I am now.
            </p>
            <p class="second Par">
                I bought things that further my passions,I love striving for greatness,I’ve been scared of failure,I’ve
                seen said failure first hand,I’m not giving up.
            </p>
            <p class="third Par">
                I learned this isn’t easy, I’ve heard it’s impossible,I’ve had set backs in my life,I once thought about
                giving up.And only one person can truly hold me accountable, that’s me
                I have been upset with some choices I’ve made
                I witnessed that with a little time you can <span>work your way back from anything
                    I will testify that you can literally do anything as long as you believe whole heartedly that you
                    can.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="fourth Par">
                I have stories about times that I’ve had no hope,<span>I found hope in the midst of those
                    stories.</span>
